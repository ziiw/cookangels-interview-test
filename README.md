## Welcome to my test repository

I applied to the Snr. Front-end position @CookAngels and was assigned this test. I made this repo in order to give you access to my source code.

### Styling

For this assignement I used the `JSX styling` method for simplicity. In bigger projects I rather prefer to use a styling file per component or page, using SASS or Stylus. When needed I also use CSS Modules, but I try to keep my CSS naming clean so I don't create naming collisions.

### Next.JS

I was assigned to make a React / Redux mini-app, so I chose to work with the `create-next-app` boilerplate. I am use to this environement and I find it easy and fast to use for quick projects like this assignement.

Below you will find the original `README.md` of the boilerplate.
